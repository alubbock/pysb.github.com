Title: Support

If you have questions about how to use PySB, we'd be happy to help. We recommend using our open chat channel on Gitter. It's accessible from your web browser, but you'll need
a Github login.

[![Get PySB support at https://gitter.im/pysb/pysb](https://badges.gitter.im/pysb/pysb.svg)](https://gitter.im/pysb/pysb?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Alternatively, if your question is more general (e.g. about numpy or scipy), we recommend posting a question to [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com/tags/pysb) and tagging it with "pysb".
