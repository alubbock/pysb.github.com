![PYSB facilitates reusable, modular model specification; integration with scientific Python; has an optimized simulation framework; and is free and open source]({filename}/images/pysb-banner.png)

**PySB is a framework for building mathematical models of biochemical systems
 as Python programs.** PySB abstracts the complex process of creating
 equations describing interactions among multiple proteins or other
 biomolecules into a simple and intuitive domain specific programming language
 (see [example](#example) below), which is internally translated into
 [BioNetGen](http://bionetgen.org) or [Kappa](http://www.kappalanguage.org)
 rules and from there into systems of equations. PySB makes it straightforward
 to divide models into modules and to call libraries of reusable elements
 (macros) that encode standard biochemical actions. These features promote
 model transparency, reuse and accuracy. PySB also interoperates with standard
 scientific Python libraries such as [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/),
 [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) and [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/), enabling
 model simulation and analysis.

# Download

To get started with PySB, see the [download page](/download.html) for
instructions.

# Documentation

All of the [PySB technical documentation](http://pysb.readthedocs.org) is
available online, courtesy of Read the Docs. The
[pysb/examples](https://github.com/pysb/pysb/tree/master/pysb/examples)
directory in the source tree contains sample models and other scripts if
you'd prefer to learn by example. One of these examples and its output is
reproduced below.

For further information, or to contact the developers, see the
[support page](/support.html).

# Contributing

Development is centered around our
[GitHub project page](https://github.com/pysb/pysb).
Bugs and other problems should be reported at the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/pysb/pysb/issues), and we
welcome pull requests for fixes and enhancements.

# Example

Model code:

    #!python
    from pysb import *
    from pysb.simulator import ScipyOdeSimulator
    from pylab import linspace, plot, xlabel, ylabel, show

    # A simple model with a reversible binding rule
    Model()

    # Declare the monomers
    Monomer('L', ['s'])
    Monomer('R', ['s'])

    # Declare the parameters
    Parameter('L_0', 100)
    Parameter('R_0', 200)
    Parameter('kf', 1e-3)
    Parameter('kr', 1e-3)

    # Declare the initial conditions
    Initial(L(s=None), L_0)
    Initial(R(s=None), R_0)

    # Declare the binding rule
    Rule('L_binds_R', L(s=None) + R(s=None) | L(s=1) % R(s=1), kf, kr)

    # Observe the complex
    Observable('LR', L(s=1) % R(s=1))

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # Simulate the model through 40 seconds
        time = linspace(0, 40, 100)
        print "Simulating..."
        sim_result = ScipyOdeSimulator(model, time).run()
        
        # Plot the trajectory of LR
        plot(time, sim_result.observables['LR'])
        xlabel('Time (seconds)')
        ylabel('Amount of LR')
        show()

The above source code is available as
[hello_pysb.py](https://github.com/pysb/pysb/blob/master/pysb/examples/hello_pysb.py)
in the directory of example models and scripts included with the PySB
distribution. Note that this simple model does not demonstrate macros or any
other higher-order features of PySB modeling. For an advanced model, see
[EARM 2.0](http://earm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html).
